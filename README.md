# Stock Ticker App

This is a basic web app that takes as input a stock ticker symbol (such as AAPL or GOOG) and a month (in the format MM/YYYY) and displays a Bokeh plot showing closing prices for the corresponding month using Alpha Vantage's TIME_SERIES_DAILY API.

The deployed app can be found [here](https://robert-sanders-tdi-milestone.herokuapp.com).
